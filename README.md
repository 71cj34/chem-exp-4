# Chem-Lab-Scripts

Scripts to complete calculations for the CHEM 1E03 labs. Some of these are really, really tedious (talking about you, Experiment 4), especially if you mess up one little thing and need to restart.

# Usage

Scripts are found in different branches. Click on the "n Branches" button (where n is a number) in Github to find the others, or just click <a href=https://github.com/71cj34/chem-lab-scripts/branches>here</a>. Alternatively, run
```
git clone -b "<branch-name>" https://github.com/71cj34/chem-lab-scripts.git
```

or

```
git clone https://github.com/71cj34/chem-lab-scripts.git && cd chem-lab-scripts
git branch -a
git checkout <branch-name>
```

Download or copy and paste the contents of the python files into your Python IDE (Spyder, Pycharm, etc), change the values to what you got from the experiment, and run it.
