# Chem-Exp-4

Automated python script to calculate the required values for experiment 4.

I had to redo the sim ~3~ ~5~ ~6~ ~8~ ~9~ 10 times because I kept messing it up and I couldn't do the whole rigamarole of calculating the enthalpy with my new values another time without losing my mind so I decided to make this to save myself some time.

# Usage

Download or copy and paste into your Python IDE (Spyder, Pycharm, etc), change the values to what you have, and run it.

### Options

Logging will output a list of variables used to a file log.txt in the same folder as the script. Helpful when you're processing the csvs into xlsx files or whatever.

The two matplotlib functions were made for fun while I was procastinating. Since you need it as an Excel graph instead, don't use it except to preview your data and make sure it's not broken.
