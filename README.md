# Chem-Exp-4

Automated python script to calculate the required values for experiment 4.

I had to redo the sim 6 times because I kept messing it up and I couldn't do the whole rigamarole of calculating the enthalpy with my new values another time without losing my mind so I decided to make this to save myself some time.
