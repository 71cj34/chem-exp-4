# Chem-Exp-4

Automated python script to calculate the required values for experiment 3.

Not nearly as annoying as Experiment 4 but I already knew the theory on how to do it so bleh.

# Usage

Download or copy and paste into your Python IDE (Spyder, Pycharm, etc), change the values to what you have, and run it.
