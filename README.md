# Chem-Exp-5

Automated python script to calculate the required values for experiment 5.

This is a painful one, lads. Good luck.

A much more involved piece of code than any other script here.

# Usage

Download or copy and paste into your Python IDE (Spyder, Pycharm, etc), change the values to what you have, and run it.

### Options

Logging will output a list of variables used to a file log.txt in the same folder as the script. Helpful when you're processing the csvs into xlsx files or whatever.

The two matplotlib functions were made for fun while I was procastinating. Since you need it as an Excel graph instead, don't use it except to preview your data and make sure it's not broken.
