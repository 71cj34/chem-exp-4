# Chem-Exp-5

Automated python script to calculate the required values for experiment 5.

This is a painful one, lads. Good luck.

A much more involved piece of code than any other script here.

# Usage

Download or copy and paste into your Python IDE (Spyder, Pycharm, etc), change the values to what you have, and run it.
