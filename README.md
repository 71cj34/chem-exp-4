# Chem-Lab-Scripts

Scripts to complete calculations for the CHEM 1E03 labs. Some of these are really, really tedious (talking about you, Experiment 4), especially if you mess up one little thing and need to restart.

# Usage

Scripts are found in different branches. Click on the "n Branches" button (where n is a number) in Github to find the others. Alternatively, run
```
git clone -b "<branch-name>" https://github.com/71cj34/chem-lab-scripts.git
```

Download or copy and paste into your Python IDE (Spyder, Pycharm, etc), change the values to what you have, and run it.
